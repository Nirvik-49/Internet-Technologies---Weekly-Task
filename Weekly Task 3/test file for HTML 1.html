    <h1>Beware of password hackers and crackers!</h1>
    <p>
        The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone. If 
        the security breach at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group 
        milworm didnâ€™t convince you of their capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka jdavis_a, a resident of 
        <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483">www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483</a> 
        homestead community on the Internet, might just be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now, 
        or using your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the 
        Net for more such accounts! Surprised? Or scared?

    <p style ="color:red">Formula:</p>
    <div class="formula"> 
        <p>(a-b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> - 2ab + b<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub></p>
    </div>

        Whatever it is, jdavis_4 claims in his home page Free VSNL passwords that he has got 
        exactly 108 working passwords (and growing daily), 36 satyam, 31 MNTL, 11 WimiNet 
        and 23 online passwords.
